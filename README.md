# Timeline Creator
A desktop application for creating, rendering, saving and reopening timelines of data.

I created this as part of my close following of SpaceX's Starship program, in advance of the first Integrated Flight Test, so that I could track events on a timeline during testing campaigns to help with understanding the operation of the ground systems.

The application has a tabbed, document-based interface and a timeline renderer that I created from scratch.
